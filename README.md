The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle named after the host of the game show "Let's Make a Deal", Monty Hall. The problem is based on a hypothetical game show where the contestant is presented with three closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a valuable prize, while the other two doors hide less valuable prizes.

The contestant starts by selecting one of the doors, but the door remains closed. At this point, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a less valuable prize. The contestant is then given the option to switch their initial choice to the remaining unopened door or stick with their original choice.

The question that the Monty Hall problem poses is whether the contestant should switch their choice or stick with their original choice in order to maximize their chances of winning the valuable prize.

The solution to the Monty Hall problem can be counter-intuitive. Many people assume that the odds of winning the valuable prize are 1 in 3 and that switching their choice would not make a difference. However, the correct answer is that the contestant should always switch their choice.

The reason for this is that the initial odds of winning the valuable prize are 1 in 3, but once the host reveals a less valuable prize, the odds of winning the valuable prize for the remaining unopened door increase to 2 in 3. This means that the contestant's best strategy is to always switch their choice, as it gives them a 2 in 3 chance of winning the valuable prize.

In this simulation, you can select the total amount of closed doors and if the player switches their choice or sticks with their original choice.
